description: "Comprehensive guide to the CrossL2ProverV2 contract for cross-chain event validation"
---

<Info>
The `CrossL2ProverV2` contract enables **on-chain validation** of cross-chain events through cryptographic proofs, providing a secure and trustless way to verify events from counterparty chains.
</Info>

## Overview

Polymer deploys the `CrossL2ProverV2` contract ([contract info](https://docs.polymerlabs.org/docs/build/start/)), inspired by Superchain interop's [CrossL2Inbox](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#crossl2inbox). Our implementation emphasizes **on-chain proof validation** with modified methods specifically designed to validate logs.

<Tip>
**Future Roadmap**: We plan to support additional claims like `validateStorage` and `validateSrcHeader`, plus new methods like `executeMessage` for secure payload delivery.
</Tip>

## Core Validation Methods

### Primary Method: validateEvent

**Validate any event with a single call.** For applications validating specific events emitted by their contracts on a given origin chain, this method provides a straightforward, plug-and-play solution.

```solidity validateEvent Function icon="shield-check" lines highlight={1}
function validateEvent(bytes calldata proof) 
    returns (
        uint32 chainId, 
        address emittingContract, 
        bytes memory topics, 
        bytes memory unindexedData
    )
```

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Function Behavior" icon="gear">
Validates a cross-chain event from a counterparty chain and returns the event along with event identifiers. **The function will revert if validation fails.**
</Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `proof` | `bytes calldata` | A byte payload containing the IAVL proof of the application's log stored in the Polymer Rollup, along with the Sequencer-attested state root and corresponding block height. |

#### Return Values

| Return Value | Type | Description |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `chainId` | `uint32` | Chain ID of the emitting chain _(identifier)_ |
| `emittingContract` | `address` | The contract which emitted the event _(identifier)_ |
| `topics` | `bytes memory` | The topics array from the emitted event (indexed data) |
| `unindexedData` | `bytes memory` | The ABI-encoded event data for the matched log (unindexed data) |

## Advanced Inspection Methods

<Warning>
These methods are **optional** and designed for applications requiring enhanced transparency and proof inspection capabilities.
</Warning>

These methods enable applications to:
- Perform static calls to examine proof contents
- Inspect origin chain transaction details 
- Verify Sequencer-attested roots against public RPC endpoints
- Match proof components against API inputs

### inspectLogIdentifier

Inspect the origin transaction that a given proof corresponds to—useful for verification against API inputs.

```solidity inspectLogIdentifier Function icon="search" lines highlight={1}
function inspectLogIdentifier(bytes calldata proof) 
    returns (
        uint32 srcChain, 
        uint64 blockNumber, 
        uint16 receiptIndex, 
        uint8 logIndex
    )
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `proof` | `bytes calldata` | A byte payload containing the IAVL proof of the application's log stored in the Polymer Rollup, along with the Sequencer-attested state root and corresponding block height. |

#### Return Values

| Return Value | Type | Description |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `srcChain` | `uint32` | Source chain that emitted the log |
| `blockNumber` | `uint64` | Block number on the source chain where the log was emitted |
| `receiptIndex` | `uint16` | Index of the transaction (receipt belongs to) in the array of all transactions in that block |
| `logIndex` | `uint8` | Index of the event in the logs array of the receipt (local to your transaction) |

<Info>
**Note**: `logIndex` is not the global log index—it's local to the specific transaction receipt.
</Info>

<Tab title="inspectPolymerState">

### inspectPolymerState

Inspect the root and corresponding block height, enabling verification against the public RPC endpoint.

```solidity inspectPolymerState Function icon="database" lines highlight={1}
function inspectPolymerState(bytes calldata proof) 
    returns (
        bytes32 stateRoot, 
        uint64 height, 
        bytes calldata signature
    )
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `proof` | `bytes calldata` | A byte payload containing the IAVL proof of the application's log stored in the Polymer Rollup, along with the Sequencer-attested state root and corresponding block height. |

#### Return Values

| Return Value | Type | Description |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `stateRoot` | `bytes32` | Represents the state of the Polymer Rollup, serving as the single source of truth |
| `height` | `uint64` | The block height corresponding to the state, used for querying the public RPC |
| `signature` | `bytes calldata` | The sequencer's attestation, committing to the root and its associated block height |

<Tip>
**Verification**: Use the returned `height` to query the public RPC and verify the `stateRoot` matches the on-chain state.

<Info>
**Security**: The `validateEvent` function will automatically revert if the proof is invalid, providing built-in security for your cross-chain operations.
